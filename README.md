# Final Project: Apple Weather App

## Description

For my final project as a part of App Team Carolina, I decided to recreate Apple's Weather App! This project provides a feature-rich weather experience, including key functionalities present in Apple's Weather App.

## Features

- **Weather Summary:** Displays the current temperature, temperature forecast, and city location.

- **Hourly Forecast:** Shows the expected temperature per hour in Fahrenheit, accompanied by an additional icon.

- **10-Day Forecast:** Presents the expected weather for the next 10 days, including a weather icon and a gradient bar depicting the relative weather.

- **Air Quality:** Depicts the current air quality level with a brief description and a gradient bar.

- **Temperature:** Displays a picture of the current location on a map with the current temperature.

- **UV Index:** Depicts the current UV Index along with a gradient bar and recommendations for sun protection.

- **Sunset:** Details the time of sunset, along with the sunrise that occurred earlier in the day.

- **Report an Issue:** A separate view for users to report inaccuracies in the current weather forecast. It includes reporting overall conditions with a toggle switch and general description buttons that users can select.

- **Notifications:** Clickable button indicating whether notifications are on or off.
